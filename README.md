### **Dynamic Methods**  
These are flexible trading techniques that adjust portfolio positions based on market conditions.  

- **Short a Stock:** Betting that a stockâ€™s price will decline, allowing profit when the price drops.  
- **Momentum Factor:** Stocks with strong past performance are likely to continue performing well, and weak stocks tend to decline further.  
- **Rebalancing:** Adjusting portfolio allocations periodically to maintain the desired level of risk and return.

### **Moving Average Strategy**  
This strategy helps in identifying trends using historical price data.  

- **Moving Average:** Computes the average stock price over a specific period to smooth out fluctuations.  
- **Moving Average Factor:** Compares short-term and long-term moving averages to determine buy/sell signals.  
- **Building the Strategy:** Buy when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and sell when it crosses below.

### **Correlation Strategy**  
This strategy selects stocks based on their price relationships.  

- **Correlation:** Measures how stocks move relative to each other.  
- **Correlation Factor:** Analyzing past price trends to predict future returns.  
- **Building the Strategy:** Invest in stocks with a strong positive correlation and avoid or short stocks with a weak or negative correlation.  

These strategies help in **maximizing returns** while managing risk dynamically. ðŸš€
